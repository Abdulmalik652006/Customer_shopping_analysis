Gamma (Presentation)
Git & GitHub (Version Control)

🔄 Project Workflow / Steps
1️⃣ Data Loading

Loaded the dataset into Python using Pandas

Inspected structure, data types, and basic statistics

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions of purchase amounts

Examined customer demographics and behavior

Identified trends by age group, gender, and category

Evaluated customer subscription patterns

3️⃣ Data Cleaning

Handled missing values

Removed duplicates

Corrected data types

Standardized categorical values

Validated numeric ranges

4️⃣ SQL Analysis

Loaded cleaned data into:

PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

Wrote SQL queries to:

Calculate total and average revenue

Segment customers by age and subscription

Identify top-performing categories

Analyze repeat purchases

5️⃣ Data Visualization

Created charts in Python:

Purchase distribution

Revenue by category

Subscription breakdown

Payment method distribution

Built an interactive dashboard using Power BI / Tableau

6️⃣ Reporting & Presentation

Compiled insights into a structured analytical report

Created a professional presentation using Gamma

Focused on business insights and recommendations

📈 Dashboard

The dashboard includes:

KPI cards (Total Customers, Avg Purchase, Avg Rating)

Revenue by product category

Sales and revenue by age group

Subscription status breakdown

Payment method distribution

Interactive filters for deeper analysis

📊 Key Results & Insights

Clothing and Accessories generate the highest revenue

Customers aged 35–55 are the most valuable segment

Non-subscribers represent the majority of customers

Payment preferences are evenly distributed

Average purchase value is approximately $60
